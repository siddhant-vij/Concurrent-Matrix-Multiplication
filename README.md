# Concurrent Matrix Multiplication

Aims to showcase the power of concurrency and multithreading across different programming environments by implementing matrix multiplication.
<br>
<br>
The project will demonstrate how to leverage the concurrency features of Java, C++, Go, and Python to improve the performance of a computationally intensive task like matrix multiplication.

## Features

- Concurrent multiplication of two matrices.
- Dynamic input of matrix sizes and values or generation of matrices with random values.
- Performance metrics comparing concurrent and sequential implementations.
- Multi-language support: Java, C++, Go, and Python.

<br>

## Technical Scope

- **Java**: Utilizing ExecutorService and Future for managing concurrent tasks.
- **C++**: Leveraging std::thread and std::future for multithreading.
- **Go**: Implementing goroutines and channels for concurrent execution.
- **Python**: Using concurrent.futures for threading or multiprocessing.
